 “Don’t let your dreams be dreams… just do it” – Legendary philosopher Shia LaBeouf

When I first started my coding journey, my father wasn’t at all two thrilled. For a bit of a background, my father is a 60+ year old Caribbean man with hands as rough as his upbringing and veins that traces the globe. Here is a man that has worked with his hands his whole life. So, you can imagine how he felt when I told him I’m that I quit my job and I’m pursuing a career in programming. Rash would be a suitable adjective; however, my decision was all but.  While my dad a pessimist and general non-believer, my mother is a firm supporter of Bilbo Baggins and Trial by Fire. As my dad stared in a manner akin to “what the fuck?” my mother was all like “go get em!”. Mothers know best.

When I first started the boot camp, I was set on continuing my job and doing the assignments when I got home from work. Though that worked for a while, I quickly realized that it was unsustainable.   I was simply too tired after work to get any meaningful value out of my assignments. I would complete between one to three assignments and just resign for the night, often forgetting everything I’ve learned by the morning. Not only was I not retaining knowledge, but with the pace I was going (3 labs a day) it would’ve taken be quite some time to complete the program.  So, after the first month of working and programming, I handed in my resignation letter and never looked back. I did this without consulting my dad prior because I knew he wouldn’t approve, but as Grace Hopper candidly said, “It’s better to beg for forgiveness than permission”.

This has by far been the second-best decisions I’ve made, the first being to start programming. By leaving my job I was able to completely focus on my coding journey without sluggish progressions and memory gaps, all it took was a meagre sacrifice of my savings and social life (repair in progress, totally worth it). Ironically. I even saved money by quitting my job because I was able to complete the program in six months as opposed to the approximate year it would’ve taken me if I hadn’t quit. Win win!
