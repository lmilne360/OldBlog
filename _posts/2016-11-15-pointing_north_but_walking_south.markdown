Alright, really quickly. For the last week, I've found myself submerged in a pool of lethargy. I had no idea the source or reason. I'd like to pin this one on motivation, or lack thereof. This had become quite the problem as you can imagine. My days had not been as productive as it should've been. My pace had been drastically reduced, I was lagging behind on the schedule I'd set for myself and just the thought of my torpor reinforced the mindset, fearing the load I will have to commit to in order to compensate for my unproductive days.

However, as the tone has suggested, this did not last. It turns out that my slight bout of unproductiveness was exactly what I needed.  Sure, the days felt kind of wasted when I didn't do much, but then I found motivation in my unmotivated state.  Turns out what I've been going through was a bit of a burnout, I tried to do too much in too little time, not allowing myself the necesary rest that promotes a healthy mind. After about a week of feeling so, I now find myself more motivated than ever. My mind feels refreshed, like my week of lethargy was just a really long nap.

I've also realized that it's quite common to get burnt out over projects. Happens to everyone at some point really. What pulled me through was just doing other things that I enjoyed. When I took a break from coding, my 'wasteful' days were spent reading comics and playing video games, things I kind of had to post-pone when I started coding.  While i was bummed about about unproductive, I was also really happy to be doing something other than working and coding. I think the change of pace really helps, gives the mind a break and new stimuli. So, my takeaway here is just to take a break once in a while, it's more beneficial than you'd think.
