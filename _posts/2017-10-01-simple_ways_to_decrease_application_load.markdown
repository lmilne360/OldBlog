So you finally finished your totally awesome site. Everything looks great and, as far as you know, there's no bug in the functionality. What do you do next? Well for me, once I have a working development product deployed and ready to go, I like to focus my efforts towards optimization.  One of the first things I focus on once I start optimization is the load time of my application. My reasoning for this is simple: the first thing a user experience when trying to use your product is the loading. Having a beautiful working application or site is awesome and all, but making users wait to view your content can really kill their buzz.
