For the final project, I decided to go with a concept I've initially touched on. When i first started coding, I had used sinatra to build a basic site to record my workout information. Weight, reps, etc etc. It felt fitting to end with an updating of that initial project. Converting a sinatra project into a angular front end single page app was no small feat, but it was undoubtably fun.
