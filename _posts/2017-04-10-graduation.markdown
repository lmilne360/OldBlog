Graduation was not what I expected it to be, at least not fully. Initially, I pictured graduation to be something synonymous to rays of light bursting through the clouds with a fair maiden handing me a golden goblet or something. But it was more akin to climbing a very steep set of stairs, reaching the end to be greeted by a talking mushroom congratulating me but proceeding to say that what I’m looking for is in another castle. That’s not to say it wasn’t gratifying, it was, but only temporarily.  When I ended my final assessment, I was overjoyed at completing another milestone. However, within a day, my mode quickly shifted from completion induced euphoria to begin-anew resolve. I still had so much to do in what always feels like scarce time.

It happened anyway. Finally, I graduated from the Flatiron Web Development Program. This came with two major implications. First and foremost, I'm now officially a web developer. Officially is perhaps too strong a self-endearing statement. I guess that doesn't come until I land my first job as a developer or something. Is there a rubric to this kind of thing? Anyway, yea, I'm a web developer. This implies that I have the basic skillsets that enable me to create functional and creative websites and webapps, an accurate implication. Within my palms, and operating system, I now wield the tools necessary to create, present, change and destroy data in an artistic manner. 

Secondly, it came as a reminder that once again I must present myself to the world at large, selling myself to the mass so that my abilities can be applied to and improved by structural allocation and repetition. Basically, I needed a job. The program itself was so intense and time consuming that, quite frankly, I did not have the time to give this much thought. Now, after countless hours writing programs and countless dreams debugging problems, I was free from cold fingers and a giant coffee thermos to face another trial. This, by the way, was my talking mushroom.  The tone may imply apprehension, but it’s quite the opposite. As an avid gamer, it is these moments of facing a new challenge that gets me fired up ([fairy tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Tail) reference) and propels me into a feral drive for domination. So, to this I say, lets-a-go!
