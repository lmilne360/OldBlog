Recently I've been putting in a lot of hours on developing a personal website, and I'm quite proud of the progress I've made thus far. However,  this week I've decided to take a different approach to programming and to try my hands at something I'm unfamiliar with: namely, mobile development.

One of the reasons I decided to explore mobile development was simple curiosity. I was just browsing the web looking at various apps and sites for inspiration and what not and stumbled upon some rather impressive apps built for mobile platforms. After the initial screenings, I figured that it would be a fun realm to explore and that it can't be that different from what I've already been doing. So I did just that, strapped in and prepared to flesh out my first mobile app.

I was wrong. I thought just because I can develop websites, I'd be able to construct a similar mobile app. Although web development skills do translate smoothly, I was a bit over my head thinking I can just apply my current knowledge in the same manner. I quickly learned that developing mobile apps required, in addition to programming skills, knowledge of development kits and native code, things I knew nothing about. So I did what I believe most programmers do in times of distress. I scoured Google looking for a way to address my problem, namely developing native apps using my knowledge of angular and HTML/CSS.

It was through this route that I stumbled upon the Ionic Framework. Ionic is an open sourced framework built on AngularJS for the purpose of developing hybrid mobile apps, which are apps built with a combination of web technologies wrapped inside a native container.  It was the solution I was looking for as it allowed me to construct mobile applications using angular and web technologies such as CSS, HTML5, and Sass. While I'm still new at this technology, it has peaked my interest and is something I intend to explore further. Time to tinker.
