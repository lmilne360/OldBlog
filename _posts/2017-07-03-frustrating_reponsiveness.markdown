So recently I've had the joy of tackling an interesting coding challenge. I was given a set of images and some functionality description and was tasked with building a fully functioning website from them.  As this was my first time facing such a challenge, you can all but imagine my excitement to complete it. Overall, the project was fairly challenging and helped me flex my design muscles. But here are the few tools that made the development process a bit more smooth.

The first tool in my repertoire of chrome extensions is Eye Dropper.  Eye Dropper is an open source extension that allows you to use color-picker to blend your own colors or pick colors off of a web page. It also saves your selected colors to a pallet for easy access, providing the name, hexadecimal and RGB value so you can easily integrate it in your application. This made the process easier for me as I was able to open the images in my browser and save the colors to my pallet instead of manually having to play around with colors until I found the ones used in the images.

Another extension that made the job easier is Page Ruler. AS the name suggests, it is an extension that allows you to apply a ruler to a web page. The really cool part is that you can use it to target specific elements of a page and it displays the width, height, and positioning (left, right, top, bottom), relative to the window, of the element you selected or area you applied the ruler.  This allows you to see the spacing of different sites if you want a similar look on your own website. Pretty simple and straightforward, but very useful.

An indispensable extension I've used is the Postman extension. The use case is quite extensive so I'll just sum up the parts I've mostly used. Postman is basically a small app that allows you to put in URL requests and returns the data you'd get from that request, be it get, post, put, delete etc. This provides an easy way to test your API requests, as you can make a request within the postman App and visualize the returned data. It also allows you to save variables to use in your request such as a query string, as well as saving the requests themselves so you don't have to constantly re-type them. As I was working with an external API, Postman allowed me to play around with the requests to make sure the received data was accurate before I applied it to my application.

Lastly, but certainly not least, the extension that saw the most use of my development process was the Responsive Web Design Tester. A shorter name would have been appreciated, but it pretty much sums up what it does. Normally when testing the responsiveness of my sites, I use the developer tools device toolbar toggle to resize my window and see how the page looks at varying device size. I've come to realize that although it fits the case for most uses, it is not a very accurate at toggling media queries and changes specific to width.  In comes RWDT. This extension allows you to test the responsiveness of your website in various windows that reflect the browser of varying mobile devices. You can test the view in an Ipad, Android phone, or a specific iPhone at the same time; or maybe just one of them, the choice is yours. You are also able to add your own device and set the parameters in the off chance that the presets does not fit your needs. This extension is absolutely indispensable for responsiveness testing.

So that sums up the main extensions I use for developing websites. Hopefully, these can be of use to you fellow developers out there
