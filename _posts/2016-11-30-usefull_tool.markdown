As many would agree to, coding is hard work. It's a long and arduous process that drowns us from time to time.  One of the biggest challenges with coding , for me personally, is remembering everything I've learned. When i first started coding, I kept a notepad at my desk where I wrote down vital information to my coding journey: definitions, syntax and all of the sort. This quickly became inefficient, as the notes became disorganized and tedious to locate specific terms. It was at this point I decided to find an alternative means of keeping up with everything I've learned.

Then I discovered [Anki](http://http://ankisrs.net/). Anki is basically your typical flash card application on steroids. It allows you to write down notes, names, and definition on both sides of a card so you can study like you would on typical flash cards (write the term on one side, definition on the other etc). What makes anki usefull is that you can create different decks in which you make your cards. For example, I have a deck just for html/css, another for rack/activerecord and another for rails. Okay, so you can create decks, wooo hooo right? Yeah woo hoo! I think it's a pretty big deal. Another great feature of anki is that you can test yourself on the contents in the deck without picking card by card. The cards are randomized, and depending on how easy it was for you to get the answer you may have to be retested on that card within a few minutes or hours or days. Basically, before my coding sessions of the day, I like to open anki and do a quick review, the app itself lets me know what needs reviewing based on my previous session etc. It's really helped me to remember things from past lessons, and I think will be a valuable tool for anyone in this coding journey.
