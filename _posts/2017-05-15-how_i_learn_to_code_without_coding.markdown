Coding is awesome, that’s a given. But let’s face it, sometimes it can be overwhelming. In those moments of high stress or just general lethargy, it helps to destress by just doing something that require minimal brain power. For me, I enjoy playing watching anime on my down time. The problem with ‘de-stressing’ when you have a lot of work to get done is that often you feel guilty about it, at least I do. To counteract this negativity, I’ve set up a few mediums that allows me to be productively unproductive.  Lifehack: Won’t feel guilty about not coding, if listening/watching/receiving stimuli from something vaguely related to coding.

## Podcasts
To me, podcasts are a great time sink. They’re effortlessly entertaining and easily accessible from any device that has internet access.  What makes podcasts an attractive learning alternative to me is that you can just play them in the background while you’re doing something else. Often, I play podcasts when I’m eating, taking the subway somewhere, or just showering. Hell, I’m listening to one right as I’m writing this post (StarTalk by Neil DeGrasse Tyson).  So, when it comes learning about coding without actually doing so, podcasts are my go-to. I find the podcast Font End Happy Hour to be a pretty lax podcast for learning front end development practices. 

## Youtube

Another way I ‘practice’ coding without physically coding is by watching tutorials on YouTube. My current flavor is an Angular 4 tutorial series by DesignCourse. YouTube is great because, unlike most podcasts, you get to actually see code being written and the visualization helps with information retention. This option is pretty much self explanatory, as I'm sure most tutorials are discovered via youtube anyway.

## LiveCoding
A third option would be to watch coding live streams. This is similar to watching coding videos on youtube, but comes with the added benefit of watching the programmer code in real time, which accurately reflects their thought process. Additionally, most live streaming services has an interactive comment section in which you can interact with the coder. The platform I use for live coding (LiveEdu) also allows the downloading of the streamers source code so I can code along if I feel like it or just play around with their code, which is pretty neat for cases in which you actually feel like coding.
