So after what seemed like forever, I finally finished up the sinatra portion of this course. I have to admit, this section was a lot more fun than i expected. When it comes to building apps/sites, its very rewarding seeing your work in action as soon as possible. So as I was going through the activerecord and restful routes section, my interest remained peaked because I was able to see my work right there in my web browser. The sinatra project building a twitter clone was also really fun because it allowed a real example of how one would go about building a social-ish site and set down the fundamentals needed for more concise web development.

The portfolio project for this section turned out to be a lot of fun for me. Unlike the previous project, which involved repetitive scraping and such, this project only required your imagination so-to-speak. What made the project really enjoyable to me was because I got to build the app/site from scratch and was able to make it about something I really enjoyed. It also allowed me to play around a bit more with the creation process and allowed more flexibility with the direction of my site.

Deciding what to base my site on was relatively easy. I just thought about something that I could apply to my everyday life and it all kind of flowed from there. Since one of my hobbies is working out, I just decided to make my application centered around that. Realizing that building an app specifically for working out would take a lot of time, I concluded that a tracker application would be a great start. That's how I came to decision to make my application a workout Tracker.

Okay, tracker is a bit of an overstatment. What I needed from my application was very simple. Usually, measuring your gym progress is rather tedious. Often people carry notepads with them to the gym, writing down their current maxes so they can test them the following week. I'm pretty lazy in that aspect and refuse to carry around a notepad with me. Thus, I made an application in which I can just enter an exercise(name) and then list my current max for it. The app/site, I really don't know what to call it, also allows me to to update my record easily and displays the record in a table format that make's it easy to read.

I had a lot of fun with this project, and I see myself putting a lot more time into it. I hope to flesh it out into a great application that I can actually use with my friends. One of the most fun projects by far.  I'm excited to see what Rails brings.
