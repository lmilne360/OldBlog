As we all know by now, coding isn't a piece of cake. As much as we wish our learning process you be a smooth updward slope, it's pretty much never that way. We're often littered with hurdles to overcome, minor setbacks along the road. Currently, I'm experiencing such setbacks and no amount of ice cream is making it better.

At the moment, working with APIs via AJAX is costing me quite a few brain cells. Not necesarily from the difficulty of it, as I'm sure the constant thinking is actually strengthening the roots in my brain, but from bashing my head against the wall a few thousand time from being unable to figure out what's being asked of me yet alone how to deliver. 

So to rant, my issue is not with the concepts. The difficulty is the way of introducing the concepts.  For example, I was recently trying to complete a certain lab which was supposed to be based on concepts previously taught.  No biggie, I thought, until I realized the lab contained fields in which weren't even mentioned previously. WTF right? Not only that, but there were not much guidance in the instructions, nor a supporting video on how to implement the new material. I was at a complete lost.

And.... still am.
