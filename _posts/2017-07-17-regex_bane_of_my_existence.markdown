So, I've just discovered CSS grid layout, and I'm completely entranced by it. For those of you not in the know,  CSS grid is a CSS layout method designed for the two-dimensional layout of items on a webpage or application. Its purpose is to promote responsive and flexible designs, similar to frameworks such as foundation or bootstrap.

The reason I'm so compelled by CSS grid layout is that it is, in my opinion, a bootstrap killer. My reasons behind this belief, though unavoidably biased, is largely pragmatic. Bootstrap is absolutely marvelous, it allows developers to create content that looks stunning across multiple platforms be it a web browser, a mobile browser, or even hybrids such as tablets. 

The downside with such a powerful framework such as Bootstrap is that it is quite robust, and can be resource heavy.  While in principle it allows websites to be really 'pretty', it makes the code rather ugly. When using bootstrap, often times our view is cluttered with empty divs just for the sake of styling, not actually contributing to functionality. We clutter our view with numerous nested divs because we need rows within rows and columns within columns just so we can get the styling we desire, and as a result, that view is a long chain of empty elements that just looks a bit daunting. CSS Grid Layout fixes that.
