First. I’ve recently discovered Ionic, a development framework that provides tool for building hybrid apps. 

Second. Finally, I’ve watched season one of daredevil on Netflix. 

Third. Started Bill Nye Saves the World, can’t say it’s what I expected but I’ll give it a shot.

Fourth. Attack On Titan (anime) new season just started and It’s pretty insane.

Fifth. Elon Musk just teased about a self-driving TRUCK (Think Optimus prime) at a ted event and talked about new underground tunnel system for more efficient commutes.
