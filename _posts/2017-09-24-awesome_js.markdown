JavaScript is an awesome language. Now, a few years ago, you’d be marked out as a weirdo for saying something like that. I think there’d probably be some kind of witch-burning ceremony or something, because JavaScript was this stupid language which had stupid syntax and stupid scope and was used to do stupid things by stupid people and just led to awful spaghetti code and killed kittens.
