For as long as I've been coding, I've faced a constant challenge of designing my applications. Often, I know exactly what I want to build, the functionalities I want to use, and the tools necessary to accomplish this, however, when it comes down to it, the look of the application is always a challenge for me. Frequently I have an idea in my head, I implement it, and then I decide it doesn't convey the application correctly. Of course, this is amended by constant revisions and continuous integration until I achieve the look and feel that I desire, but boy does it take some time.
