For as long as I've been coding, I've faced a constant challenge of designing my applications. Often, I know exactly what I want to build, the functionalities I want to use, and the tools necessary to accomplish this, however, when it comes down to it, the look of the application is always a challenge for me. Frequently I have an idea in my head, I implement it, and then I decide it doesn't convey the application correctly. Of course, this is amended by constant revisions and continuous integration until I achieve the look and feel that I desire, but boy does it take some time.

Thankfully, my designing challenge has become less challenging. This is because I've been recently been introduced to Mockups. If you don't know, a mockup is a model of a design used primarily for design demonstration and evaluation. It is a static (usually) visual representation of the intended finish product.  This is the 'website' that you show your client to get feedback from before you actually begin hard-coding the application.

Mockups have made my development process significantly easier because there are fewer variables to deal with.  Certainly not unique to me, when I'm working on a design I often jump around and do some data manipulation, route renaming, code cleaning etc. However, when designing a mockup I'm allowed to only focus on the design because there's no code to mess with or data to manipulate. Once again, a mockup is only visual so you don't have to feed it data (aside from maybe some dummy text to take up space) from a backend or anything of the sort. It streamlines the design process without the distracting code clutter.
