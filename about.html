<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p>I’m a synth working for Qualia. Just kidding...I work for The Institute.</p>

<h3> The Gist </h3>
<p> I build websites and gaming desktops. When I'm not coding, you can find me working out or playing games. One of my life goals is to speak at a Tedx Event, not sure about what though...</p>

<h3> The Not-So-Gist </h3>
<p> I'm Laurent Milne, my friends call me Laurent, last name optional.
  I was born in Guyana (That’s in South America people, not Africa!) where most of my childhood was spent. After escaping clean air and natural  foods, I resettled in Brooklyn New York. I attended State University of New York at Albany (SUNY Albany for short) for my undergrad 
  where I earned my Bachelors in Biology, avec une matière secondaire en francais.
  After graduation I worked in retail with a brief stunt as a Veterinary Technician, until I fell in love with coding. I packed up everything (figuratively, I still live in Brooklyn) and chased my newfound dream of being a programmer.
  So here I am, a fully-fledged web developer ready to take on the world
