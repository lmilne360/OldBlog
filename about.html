<p id="about"> My name's Laurent, my friends call me Laurent.
  I was born in Guyana (That’s in South America people, not Africa!) where most of my childhood was spent. After escaping clean air and natural foods, I resettled in Brooklyn, New York. I attended State University of New York at Albany (SUNY Albany for short) for my undergrad 
  where I earned my Bachelors in Biology, avec une matière secondaire en francais.
  After graduation I worked in retail with a brief stunt as a Veterinary Technician, until I fell in love with coding. I packed up everything (figuratively, I still live in Brooklyn) and chased my newfound dream of becoming a programmer.
